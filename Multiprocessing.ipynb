        "#Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
        "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of the Python programming language to execute multiple processes or tasks concurrently. It allows you to run multiple instances of a program, called processes, simultaneously on a multi-core processor or across multiple processors.\n",
        "\n",
        "It improves performance by executing tasks in parallel, utilizes system resources effectively, improves responsiveness when dealing with I/O operations, provides fault tolerance, and exploits parallelism for tasks that can be divided into smaller parts."

        "#Q2. What are the differences between multiprocessing and multithreading?\n",
        "Multiprocessing allows running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space. It achieves true parallelism by utilizing separate processors or CPU cores, which can lead to improved performance. However, it comes with higher memory overhead since each process has its own memory resources. To communicate and synchronize between processes, explicit mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory need to be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space. Threads are lighter weight than processes and can be more efficient in terms of memory usage.This limitation can impact performance in certain scenarios. Communication and synchronization between threads can be simpler as they can directly access shared variables, but care must be taken to avoid synchronization issues like data races or deadlocks."
