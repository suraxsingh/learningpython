It helps achieve concurrency and parallelism, making your program more responsive and efficient. It also enables asynchronous operations and provides synchronization mechanisms for coordinating thread execution and managing shared resources. In short, the `threading` module is used to make your program faster, more efficient, and able to perform multiple tasks at the same time.\n",
